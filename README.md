# Project 2: Cafe Menu - Responsive Web Design (FCC)
##### This repository contains the completed code for Project 2 in the FreeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design" course.

This project focuses on building a responsive menu for a fictional cafe using basic HTML and external CSS.

## Project Overview

The **Cafe Menu** project demonstrates how to structure a webpage with HTML and style it using CSS. The project highlights essential web development concepts, such as responsive design, layout creation, and basic CSS styling.

### Key Features

- **Semantic HTML**: The project uses semantic HTML5 tags like `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` to structure the webpage properly.
- **CSS Styling**: The project is styled using a separate CSS file, which includes layout and text styling.
- **Images and Text Alignment**: Images and text are aligned to create a visually appealing cafe menu for both coffee and dessert items.
- **Price Layout**: Each coffee or dessert item is paired with its corresponding price, with both elements placed side-by-side using CSS.
- **Footer with Link**: The page includes a footer with a link to the FreeCodeCamp website and the cafe's address.

## Code Details

### HTML Structure:

- **Main Sections**:
  - **Header**: Displays the name of the cafe and the establishment year.
  - **Coffee Section**: Contains a list of coffee items with their corresponding prices.
  - **Dessert Section**: Displays a list of dessert items with prices.
  - **Footer**: Provides a link to the FreeCodeCamp website and an address for the cafe.

### CSS Details:

- **External CSS**: The styling is done in a separate `styles.css` file to keep the HTML clean and maintainable.
- **Text Alignment**: CSS is used to align the flavor/dessert names on the left and the prices on the right.
- **Image Styling**: Small images of coffee and pie are included next to each section, styled via CSS.
